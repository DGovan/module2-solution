            <p>  When I taught myself to cook at home, I immediately discovered most recipes aren’t written for anxious beginners.
                 Instead, they assume the cook is already competent and looking to level up or add another dish to their repertoire.

            <p>  The rewards and demands of social media virality have only supercharged recipes’ emphasis on novelty and visual beauty.
                 As someone who now knows how to cook, I love reading about a hack for cooking short ribs or a surprising use for my rice cooker.

            <p>  But back when I barely knew how to boil water, recipes telling me which tweak or technique yielded ideal results made turning on the oven feel high stakes.
                 All that emphasis on aspiration and perfection made it way too hard to get started.
